## [Individual work](https://github.com/highbrow-228/Artificial-intelligence-methods-and-systems/tree/main/individual-work):
  The paper is devoted to the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10/overview). A model with **two convolutional** and **two fully connected layers** was implemented, using `ReLU`, `MaxPooling`, `Dropout` and other techniques to improve the results.
  
  
  
  The model achieved a maximum accuracy of `79.6%` on the validation data, effectively classifying most classes, but showing difficulties with visually similar objects such as `cat` and `dog`. The training, loss and accuracy graphs are presented, as well as the correlation matrix analysis.
